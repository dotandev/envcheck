**envcheck** is a lightweight CLI tool that validates your development environment against project requirements. Say goodbye to "works on my machine" problems!

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Fast** - Written in Rust, single binary, no dependencies
- 📝 **Simple** - Just add a `.envcheck.yaml` file to your project
- 🔍 **Comprehensive** - Check tools, versions, env vars, ports, and files
- 🎨 **Beautiful** - Clear, colored output with actionable suggestions
- 🌍 **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- 🤝 **Community-driven** - Easy to extend with new validators

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using cargo
cargo install envcheck

# Or download from releases
# https://github.com/dotandev/envcheck/releases
```

### Usage

1. Create a `.envcheck.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
version: "1"

tools:
  - name: node
    version: ">=18.0.0"
    required: true
  - name: docker
    required: true

env_vars:
  - name: DATABASE_URL
    required: true

ports:
  - 3000

files:
  - path: .env
    required: true
```

2. Run `envcheck`:

```bash
$ envcheck

Running environment checks...

✓ node 18.17.0 found
✓ docker found
✗ DATABASE_URL is not set
  Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
✓ Port 3000 is available
✓ .env exists

❌ 1 issue(s) found. Fix them to continue.
```

## 📖 Configuration

### Tools

Check if tools are installed and optionally verify versions:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: node
    version: ">=18.0.0"  # Supports >=, <=, >, <, =
    required: true
  - name: docker
    required: false      # Optional tools won't fail the check
```

Supported tools out of the box:
- `node`, `npm`, `go`, `rust`, `cargo`, `python`, `docker`, `git`, `java`, `ruby`

### Environment Variables

Validate that required environment variables are set:

```yaml
env_vars:
  - name: DATABASE_URL
    required: true
  - name: DEBUG
    required: false
```

### Ports

Check if ports are available:

```yaml
ports:
  - 3000
  - 5432
  - 8080
```

### Files

Verify that required files exist:

```yaml
files:
  - path: .env
    required: true
  - path: config/database.yml
    required: false
```
